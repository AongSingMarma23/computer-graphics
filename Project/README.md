# City Scenery OpenGL Project

This project displays an **animated 2D city scenery** using **OpenGL (GLUT)** and classic computer graphics algorithms.

## Output Analysis
- A city scene with **sky, mountains, buildings, road, water, trees, car, and boat** is displayed.
- The scene supports **Day and Night modes**:
  - Day mode shows a bright sky and sun.
  - Night mode shows a dark sky, stars, moon, and glowing street lamps.
- A **car moves on the road** with rotating wheels using keyboard input.
- A **boat moves on water** and can be toggled on/off.
- Trees sway using **shearing transformation**.
- Water shows **reflection and flowing wave effects**.
- Graphics algorithms used:
  - DDA for lines
  - Bresenham for shapes
  - Midpoint circle for circular objects

## Controls
- **D** – Day mode  
- **N** – Night mode  
- **← / →** – Move car  
- **C** – Move car forward  
- **B** – Toggle boat movement  

## Conclusion
The output demonstrates an interactive and animated city scene combining graphics algorithms, transformations, and user interaction.
